## How the Web Works:
### *The web works through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (**HTTP**)*...

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The protocol for transmitting data on the internet. When a web address is entered into a browser, it sends a request to a web server using HTTP.

- **Web Servers:** These servers store website files and respond to HTTP requests by sending the requested files back to the browser.

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** DNS translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses, allowing browsers to locate the correct web servers.

> *In short, **HTTP** facilitates communication between browsers and **web servers**, while **DNS** ensures that users can access websites using easy-to-remember domain names.*
