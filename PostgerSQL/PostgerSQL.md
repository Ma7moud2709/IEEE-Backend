# IEEE Back-End Task-1

**what is RDBMS?**

- _A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update, administer and otherwise interact with a relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables, with most commercial relational database management systems using Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database._

- _The RDBMS is the most popular database system among organizations across the world. It provides a dependable method of storing and retrieving large amounts of data while offering a combination of system performance and ease of implementation._

**RDBMS VS DBMS:**

_An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure which connects related data elements._

- **Number of allowed users:** <br>
  *While a DBMS can only accept one user at a time, an RDBMS can operate with multiple users.*

- **Amount of data:** <br> *RDBMSes can handle any amount of data, from small to large, while a DBMS can only manage small amounts.*

- **Database structure:** <br> *In a DBMS, data is kept in a hierarchical form, whereas an RDBMS utilizes a table where the headers are used as column names and the rows contain the corresponding values.*

**What is PostgerSQL:**
<br>

* *PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2* 
* *PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and **offers many modern features:***

    * Complex queries
    * Foreign keys 
    * Triggers
    * Updatable views

**PostgerSQl Clients:**
<br>

* *the clients are just wrappers over SQL commands that get executed on the server and return a response using client server*

**What purpose does pgAdmin serve in PostgreSQL?**

* *to provide a graphical administration tool to make it easier to manipulate schema and data in PostgreSQL*
