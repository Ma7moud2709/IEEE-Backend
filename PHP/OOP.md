* ### Encapsulation:
    refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a `class`. It helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing the necessary functionalities. 
* ### Abstraction:
    on the other hand, is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the necessary parts to the outside world. In PHP, you achieve encapsulation and abstraction through access modifiers like public, private, and protected.

* ## Inheritance

    Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. In PHP, you use the `extends` keyword to implement inheritance.

* ## PHP Interfaces & Polymorphism

    Interfaces in PHP define a contract that classes can implement, specifying methods that must be defined within those classes. This promotes code consistency and allows for polymorphism, where objects can be treated as instances of their parent class or interface. PHP uses the `implements` keyword to implement interfaces and achieve polymorphism.

* ## PHP Traits

    Traits in PHP provide a way to reuse methods in multiple classes. They are similar to classes but cannot be instantiated on their own. Traits are used to group functionality in a fine-grained and reusable manner, allowing classes to include multiple traits to inherit their methods. You use the `use` keyword in PHP to include traits in a class.
