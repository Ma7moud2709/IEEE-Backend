# IEEE Task-7

### What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and has since evolved into a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages

### Three Main Error Types in PHP

- **Notice:** Non-critical errors during script execution, indicating potential issues but not halting execution.
- **Warning:** More severe than notices, warning of potential problems that could cause unexpected behavior, although they don't stop script execution.
- **Fatal Error:** Most severe PHP errors, encountered in situations like calling undefined functions or syntax errors, leading to immediate termination of the script.


### Echo vs. Print



- **Echo:** Echo is a language construct rather than a function, so it doesn't require parentheses when used. It can output multiple strings separated by commas and is generally faster than print. Echo doesn't return any value.

- **Print:** Print is also a language construct, but it behaves like a function, requiring parentheses when used. It only allows for outputting one string at a time and returns 1, making it suitable for use in expressions.


### Sensitivity in PHP

- PHP is case-sensitive for variable names but not for function names or keywords.
